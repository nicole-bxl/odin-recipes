        <li>1kg skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>100ml olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>200ml chicken stock, plus splash to deglaze pan</li>
        <li>chopped fresh oregano for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220 degrees C. Lightly oil a large roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Place chicken pieces in large bowl. Season with salt, oregano, pepper, rosemary, and cayenne pepper. Add fresh lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic. Place potatoes in bowl with the chicken; stir together until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated with marinade.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken pieces, skin side up, to prepared roasting pan, reserving marinade. Distribute potato pieces among chicken thighs. Drizzle with chicken stock. Spoon remainder of marinade over chicken and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Place in preheated oven. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes, keeping chicken skin side up; continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 75 degrees C. Transfer chicken to serving dish and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Set oven to grill or highest heat setting. Toss potatoes once again in pan juices. Place pan under broiler and broil until potatoes are caramelized, about 3 minutes. Transfer potatoes to serving dish with chicken.</li>
        <li>Place roasting pan on stove over medium heat. Add a splash of stock and stir up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Strain; spoon juices over chicken and potatoes. Top with chopped oregano.</li>
